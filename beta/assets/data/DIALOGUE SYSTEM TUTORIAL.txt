DIALOGUE SYSTEM TUTORIAL:

:: - character data, can range from bf to senpai or even the ones you make. To create a new character, make a file in assets/shared/images/portraits and name it however you want, then make an xml file named the same, it will be useful for animations. There are no limits to this one.

!! - character's emotion, signified by an animation name. To make one, make a graphic for it inside of an image representing the character and then declare it inside of its xml file. There are no limits to this one.

[[ - font name. If you don't know what font you could use, check your fonts folder and check what name they have when you open them. NOTE: IF THEY DON'T DISPLAY PROPERLY, THIS MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FONT INSTALLED. INSTALL A FONT TO FIX THIS ISSUE. MOD MAKERS: IF YOU HAVE A FONT SUPPLIED THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE INSTALLED, MAKE SURE TO PACK THEM WITH YOUR RELEASE!

]] - font scale. Accepts only full numbers from 1 to infinity. This one does matter from font to font, so be careful of what you pick.

** - music volume. Accepted values: 0-100, but it can go higher if you want to.

== - shake amount, where your screen shakes for a duration of time. Accepted values are from zero to positive infinity, but 0.001 is the perfect base because it will shake so much when it's set to 1.

++ - To calculate this, it takes the writing speed and multiplies it by the number of characters you want it to be shake for, including spaces. So for example, if writing speed is 0.05 and the number of characters is 10, it will shake for 0.5 seconds.

-- - shake delay, whenever you want it to occur at a specific moment. To calculate this, it takes the writing speed and multiplies it by the number of characters you want it to be shake after, including spaces. So for example, if writing speed is 0.05 and the number of characters is 10, it will shake after 0.5 seconds.

<< - flash duration, with a whiplash sound effect coming to it. To calculate this, it takes the writing speed and multiplies it by the number of characters you want it to flash for, including spaces. So for example, if writing speed is 0.05 and the number of characters is 10, it will flash for 0.5 seconds.

>> - flash delay, whenever you want it to occur at a specific moment. To calculate this, it takes the writing speed and multiplies it by the number of characters you want it to be flash after, including spaces. So for example, if writing speed is 0.05 and the number of characters is 10, it will flash after 0.5 seconds.

;; - writing speed of the dialogue, whenever you want to make them speak more intimidatingly or something. Be wary, as it will write another character per the duration you set it to, so it's best to have it around 0.04 as a base.

|| - whether you want to flip your character to another side or not. Can be true, or false.

## - dialogue box, can be anything. To create a new box, make a file in assets/shared/images/dialogueBoxes and name it however you want, then make an xml file named the same with two animations: 'open' and 'normal'. There are no limits to this one.

^^ - dialogue sounds for a character to speak. to make a new dialogue sound, make a file in assets/shared/sounds/dialogueSounds.

!! - text color.  Filled in a #AARRGGBB fashion. AA - alpha, RR - red, GG - green, BB - blue, all valued in hex.

?? - text shadow color. Filled in a #AARRGGBB fashion. AA - alpha, RR - red, GG - green, BB - blue, all valued in hex.

.. - portrait color, for any special occasions. Can be blank, or filled in a #AARRGGBB fashion. AA - alpha, RR - red, GG - green, BB - blue, all valued in hex.

~~ - time it takes to cut to the next line of dialogue. To calculate this, it takes the writing speed and multiplies it by the number of characters you want it to be skipped after, including spaces. So for example, if writing speed is 0.05 and the number of characters is 10, it will skip to the next dialogue after 0.5 seconds.
